# AI Research Intern Screening Assignment: LLM Fine-tuning for Small Models - Exploratory Study

## Overview

This is a screening assignment for our AI Research Intern position. The task involves conducting an exploratory research study on fine-tuning approaches for small-size Large Language Models (LLMs) from prominent open-source families like Qwen, Llama, and DeepSeek. The goal is to investigate efficient and effective fine-tuning methodologies suitable for resource-constrained environments and document your findings in a short academic-style research paper.

## Background

The rapid advancement of Large Language Models has opened up exciting possibilities across various applications. However, deploying and fine-tuning these models, especially the larger ones, can be computationally expensive and resource-intensive. There is growing interest in leveraging smaller, yet capable, LLMs for specific tasks, particularly in scenarios with limited computational resources or latency requirements. Models like Qwen, Llama, and DeepSeek offer smaller variations that are promising candidates for fine-tuning and deployment in such settings.

This assignment focuses on exploring different fine-tuning approaches for these smaller LLMs and understanding their performance characteristics when adapted for specific downstream tasks. The findings will help us identify promising strategies for efficient and effective fine-tuning of small LLMs within our research team.

## Task Description

Conduct an exploratory research study investigating different fine-tuning approaches applicable to small-size LLMs (specifically from the Qwen, Llama, or DeepSeek families). Your research should aim to:

*   **Select a relevant downstream task:** Choose a specific natural language processing task suitable for evaluating LLM fine-tuning (e.g., text classification, question answering, text summarization, etc.). Clearly justify your choice of task and its relevance to evaluating fine-tuning efficacy.

*   **Choose one or more small LLMs:** Select at least one (ideally up to two or three for comparative analysis, if time permits) small-size LLMs from the Qwen, Llama, or DeepSeek families. Justify your model selection based on factors like model size, architecture, pre-training data, and reported performance.

*   **Experiment with different fine-tuning approaches:** Explore and implement at least two different fine-tuning techniques. This could include (but is not limited to):

    *   **Full Fine-tuning:** Traditional fine-tuning of all model parameters.
    *   **Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT) techniques:** Investigate and implement methods like LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation), Adapter modules, Prefix-tuning, Prompt-tuning, etc. Explain the rationale behind your chosen PEFT methods.
    *   **Instruction Fine-tuning:** If applicable and relevant to your chosen task, explore instruction fine-tuning strategies using appropriate datasets.

*   **Evaluate and compare the performance:** Quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate the performance of the fine-tuned models on your chosen downstream task. Utilize appropriate evaluation metrics relevant to your task (e.g., accuracy, F1-score, BLEU, ROUGE, etc.). Compare the performance of different fine-tuning approaches and models.

*   **Analyze and document findings:** Analyze your experimental results, identify key observations, and draw conclusions about the effectiveness and efficiency of different fine-tuning approaches for small LLMs. Document your research process, findings, and observations in a short research paper.

## Dataset

For your fine-tuning experiments, you are expected to utilize publicly available datasets relevant to your chosen downstream task. You should:

*   Identify and select a suitable dataset(s) for your chosen downstream task.
